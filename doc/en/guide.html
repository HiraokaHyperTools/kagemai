<h2 id="what_is">What is Kagemai?</h2>

<p>
Kagemai is a bug tracking system written in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>.  It aims to be a easy-to-use system for small projects or individual to-do lists.</p>

<p>
To make Kagemai as easy to use as possible, it is distributed as a
single working unit (with the exception of Ruby).  You can use all of
its basic functions right away, even if you do not get libraries from
other locations, compile extension libraries, or set up a database.
Also, unlike many other bug tracking systems that require e-mail usage,
Kagemai works with no problem even if you cannot use e-mail.  And once
you install Kagemai, it will let you perform administration tasks
without having to log into the server (although this feature is not
quite sufficiently implemented yet).</p> 

<p>
As of January 15, 2005, one can do the following things with Kagemai:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Submit bug reports and replies via Web forms or e-mail
  <li>Set the status and severity of reports when submitting or replying
  to them
  <li>Notify project administrators and other e-mail addresses when a report or reply is submitted
  <li>Search for reports by keyword, field value, or date
  <li>Split reports if they contain information on multiple bugs
  <li>Syndicate the contents of bug reports and replies with RSS
  <li>Create, delete, and change settings for projects using a Web
  interface
  <li>Customize report fields (status, severity, owner, etc.) for each project
  <li>Customize every page of the user interface for each project
  <li>Turn customized projects into templates and reuse them in other projects
  <li>Save data using text files, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL server, and
  change the save format at any time
  <li>Handle Japanese
</ul>

<p>
Kagemai is in its early stages of development. However, if you are
looking for a bug tracking system that can be used for individual,
small-scale projects, it will be worth it to try out Kagemai. Since
installing Kagemai is simple, you will not lose much if you try it out
and end up not liking it.  If you try it and find that it does not suit you, please send e-mail to the 
<a href="http://www.daifukuya.com/kagemai/index.html#ml">kagemai-users mailing list</a> saying what you did not like.  Even if you liked Kagemai and decided to use it, your thoughts, suggestions, and bug reports for Kagemai itself are greatly appreciated.  Both positive and negative opinions spur Kagemai's progress.

<h2 id="install">Installing Kagemai</h2>

<p>Please refer to the <a href="install.html">installation guide</a> for instructions on installing Kagemai.</p>

<h2 id="mode">User categories</h2>

<p>Kagemai divides its users into guests, users, and admins.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Guests</dt>
  <dd>Restricted to a few functions. They can create reports, post replies, and search for reports, but may not be able to change certain report fields, such as the status. (This depends on the settings for the project.)</dd>

  <dt>Users</dt>
  <dd>In addition to having all the privileges of guests, users can also change report fields such as status.</dd>

  <dt>Admins</dt>
  <dd>The administrators of Kagemai. In addition to having all the privileges of guests and users, admins can create, delete, and change the settings of projects.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Kagemai distinguishes guests, users, and admins by the CGI script they call (guest.cgi, user.cgi, and admin.cgi, respectively).  Kagemai does not perform any user authentication of its own; instead, restrict access to these scripts as needed using the functions of your Web server.</p>

<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->


<h2 id="global-config">Global settings</h2>

<p>
Global settings affect all of Kagemai.  They are saved in the configuration file specified in guest.cgi (kagemai.conf).  The default global setting values are written in config.rb, but you will normally not ever need to change config.rb directly.
</p>

<p>
If you carelessly change the values of <var>language</var>, <var>action_dir</var>, <var>resource_dir</var>, <var>default_template_dir</var>, <var>message_bundle_name</var>, or <var>admin_mode_cgi</var>, Kagemai will no longer function.  If this happens, edit kagemai.conf directly and remove the parts that specify those settings.</p>

<h3 id="mail-configuration">Mail configuration</h3>

<p>In Kagemai, you can use SMTP, the mail command, or the sendmail command for sending e-mail.  You can specify which one to use in the global setting <var>mailer</var>.

<table>
  <tr class="even">
    <th>Kagemai::SmtpMailer</th>

    <th>Kagemai::MailCommandMailer</th>
    <td>Send mail using the mail command.  If you have specified MailCommandMailer, you will need to set <var>mail_command</var> and the path to the mail command correctly as well.  You can send mail even in environments where an SMTP server cannot be used.

  </tr>

  <tr class="even">
    <th>Kagemai::SendmailCommandMailer</th>
    <td>Send mail using the sendmail command.  If you have specified SendMailCommandMailer, you will need to set <var>mail_command</var> and the path to the sendmail command correctly as well.

<h2 id="project-management">Managing projects</h2>

<h3 id="create-project">Creating projects</h3>

<p>Below are the options available for creating a new project.</p>

<table>
  <tr class="even">
    <th>ID</th>
    <td>ID for Kagemai to identify the project.  Information for each project is saved in a directory with the same name as the project's ID, under the directory specified in the global setting <var>project_dir</var>.  You can only use alphanumeric characters for the ID; in addition, you cannot use "CVS" for an ID.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="odd">
    <th>Name</th>
    <td>Name for end users to identify the project.
    Select a name that is easy to understand.</td>       
  </tr>

  <tr class="even">
    <th>Description</th>
    <td>Description that will appear in the projects list.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="odd">
    <th>Admin address</th>
    <td>E-mail address of the project administrator.
    If this is set, it will be used as the sender address for notification e-mails.  Make sure to set this to a valid e-mail address.  If the admin address is not set, the e-mail notification function will be disabled.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="even">
    <th>Submission address</th>
    <td>E-mail address for receiving reports.  The e-mail address specified here will be placed in the Reply-To line of notification e-mails.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="odd">
    <th>Notification address</th>
    <td>E-mail address(es) that you would like to have notified when reports or replies are submitted.  Mail addresses specified here will be placed in the Bcc line of notification e-mails.</td>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="even">
    <th>Line wrap width</th>
    <td>Number of characters at which long text lines will be wrapped in report displays on the Web and in sent e-mail.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="odd">
    <th>Bug ID padding</th>
    <td>Number of digits used for padding when the report ID is inserted into the subject of an e-mail. For example, if the project ID is test_project, the report ID is 1, and this option is set to 4, [test_project:00001] will be added to the beginning of the subject.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="even">
    <th>Stylesheet URL</th>
    <td>URL for the project's style sheet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="odd">
    <th>Save format</th>
    <td>Format for saving data.
    The default is to save data for one report in one text file; you can select this behavior by selecting Kagemai::XMLFileStore.  If you set up support for PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or MySQL, you will be able to select them as save formats.  You can also change the data save format after creating the project.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
    <th>Template</th>
    <td>Template for the project.  
    Report forms differ for each template.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="odd">
    <th>Top page</th>
    <td>Items that will appear on the main page for the project.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
With the exception of <var>ID</var> and <var>Template</var>, you can change any of the options after creating the project.
</p>

<h3 id="delete-project">Deleting projects</h3>

<p>When deleting a project, you can delete the project completely, or delete the project without deleting its data.</p>

<p>However, if you delete a project that saved data using PostgreSQL, but do not delete its data, you cannot create a new project that has the same ID as the previous project and saves data using PostgreSQL.  (You can select PostgreSQL as a save format, but it will result in an error.)</p>

<h3 id="config-project">Configuring projects</h3>

<p>
Other than for <var>ID</var> and <var>template</var>, you can change the options of a project after creating it.
</p>

<p>If there are a large number of reports, it is recommended that you save data using a database and that you do not display the bug list on the front page.</p>

<h3 id="backup-project">Backing up data</h3>

<p>If you need to back up project data, save the files in the global setting <var>project_dir</var>.  If you are using a database to store project data, it will need to be backed up as well.</p>

<h3 id="security">Important security notes</h3>

<p>This may be obvious, but if the Web server user can read and write project data, anyone who can configure CGIs to run with that user's rights can manage project data.  There are several ways to avoid this situation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use suexec and have the CGIs run under that user's account
  <li>Use suexec and set the permissions of the project data directories so that only a certain user can read and write from them
  <li>Use databases for project data that needs to be protected
  <li>Do not create non-admin user accounts on the server where Kagemai is located
</ul>

<p>Investigate other options as needed.</p>

<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

<h2 id="customize">Customization</h2>

<h3 id="field-config">Customizing fields</h3>

<p>Kagemai allows you to customize the report fields for every project.  This section explains the options for fields and options for individual choices in a field.</p>

<p>You can set the options below for every field.</p>

<table>
  <tr class="even">
    <th>Save the value of this field in a cookie</th>
    <td>Whether or not to save the entered value in a cookie, if the user has chosen to use cookies.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="odd">
    <th>Check e-mail address</th>
    <td>Whether or not to check if the submitted value is a valid e-mail address.  If you perform the check, values that are not valid e-mail addresses will return an error.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="even">
    <th>Make this field a report property</th>
    <td>Whether or not to make this field a report property.  Status, priority, and report-specific values are set to be report properties.  The sender's e-mail address and the message contents are not.</td>
  <tr class="odd">
    <th>Allow guests to change this field</th>
    <td>If the field is a report property, this specifies whether or not guests can alter the field.  If guests are not allowed to change the value, you cannot have it appear on the new report form for guests or on the reply form.</td>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="even">
    <th>Allow users to change this field</th>
    <td>If the field is a report property, this specifies whether or not users can alter the field.  If users are not allowed to change this value, you cannot have it appear on the new report form for users or on the reply form.  (Admins can change the values of any field, even if guests and users cannot.)</td>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="odd">
    <th>Display as a report index item</th>
    <td>Whether or not to display the field in the report index on the main page or the search results page.  This only applies to fields that are report properties.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="even">
    <th>Display in log message headers</th>
    <td>Whether or not to display the field in the log message headers on the report details page.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="odd">
    <th>Display on a separate line in log message headers</th>
    <td>Whether or not to display the field in message log headers on a separate line.  For example, you can customize headers to show the e-mail address on a separate line, and status and priorities together on another line.</td>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="even">
    <th>Hide from guests</th>
    <td>Whether or not to show the field to guests.  When this is set to on, guests will be unable to see the field.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="odd">
    <th>Use as an index on the project home page</th>
    <td>If the field is a single-selection or a multiple-selection box and is set to be a report property, this specifies whether or not to create a report list on the top page based on the field, with reports separated by field value.  Set this if you want a list of reports separated by status, for example.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="even">
    <th>Display as a radio button</th>
    <td>If the field is a single-selection field, this specifies whether or not to display the field as a checkmark.  When this is off, it will be a list box.</td>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="odd">

    <th>Display as a checkbox</th>
    <td>If the field is a multiple-selection field, this specifies whether or not to display the field as a set of checkboxes.  When this is off, it will be a list box.</td>
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<p>You can always add fields and change the settings of fields.  However, if reports have already been submitted for a project, you cannot add fields that lack a default value.</p>

<p>
In addition, a field choice editing form will be displayed after for selection fields after they have been added or edited.  You can change the following items for each choice in the field:</p>

<table>
  <tr class="even">
    <th>Short description</th>
    <td>Short description of the choice.  This will become a heading if the field is used as an index on the top page.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="odd">
    <th>Long description</th>
    <td>Long description of the choice.
    If the field is used as an index, this will be displayed as a supplementary description.</td>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="even">
    <th>Display on the top page</th>
    <td>Whether or not to display the choice on the top page.
    If the field is not used as an index, this setting will have no effect.</td>
  </tr>

</table>


<h3 id="template-config">Customizing page templates</h3>

<p>If you place files with the same name as the default page templates in the template directory for a project, they will be used first when the page is created.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a href="page-template.html">template file list</a> and the source code to find out how each template file is used.</p>

<h3 id="project-script">Individual scripts for projects</h3>

<p>*.rb files placed in the script directory for a project will automatically be loaded and evaluated when a CGI script is run.  By placing scripts in the script directory, you can change the rendering methods for report fields or manage messages at the time of submission, among other things.</p>

<p>At the moment, the following experimental scripts have been prepared to handle functions that cannot be done generically:</p>

<table>
  <tr class="even">
    <th>color.rb</th>
    <td>Changes the display color of field choices depending on their value.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="odd">
    <th>replace.rb</th>
    <td>Replaces characters in fields when HTML is generated.  It is used to replace the "@" symbol with "at" in e-mail addresses.</td>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="even">
    <th>email_message.rb</th>
    <td>Sends mail to the owner of a report after it has been assigned an owner.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="odd">
    <th>depend.rb</th>
    <td>Converts the ID of the bug entered in the "Depends on" field into a link to that bug.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="even">
    <th>change_status.rb</th>
    <td>Automatically changes the values of fields when a message is submitted.  (Because the script depends on the content of the field choices, if you comment it all out, it will no longer do anything.)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>All scripts in the script directory will be run at safe level 1.</p>

<h3 id="regist-template">Creating project templates</h3>

<p>You can turn settings from customized projects (fields, templates, scripts, etc.) intoa project template and reuse them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a directory under the template directory (resource/en/template).  The directory name will become the ID of the template.

<pre>
  $ cd /usr/local/kagemai/resource/en/template
  $ mkdir my_template
</pre>

<li>Copy reporttype.xml, template/*, and script/*.rb from the project you wish to turn into a template.

<pre>
  $ cp /var/lib/kagemai/project/custom/reporttype.xml my_template
  $ cp -r /var/lib/kagemai/project/custom/template my_template
  $ cp -r /var/lib/kagemai/project/custom/script my_template
</pre>

  <li>In reporttype.xml, edit the id and name of the ReportType element.  Also, edit the description element, inserting a description of the template.

<pre>
  $ head -7 reporttype.xml
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

  &lt;ReportType id="my_template" name="My template"&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;
      This is my customized template!
    &lt;/description&gt;
</pre>

  <li>Load the project creation form and verify that the new template is listed as an option.

</ul>

<h2 id="mail-command">Changing a report's status via e-mail</h2>

<p>If you are submitting reports and replies via e-mail and have set the global setting <var>allow_mail_body_command</var> to be true, you can change field values such as the status within the body of e-mails.</p>

<p>To do this, begin a line with "# kagemai : ", then enter the name of the field and the new value, separated by an equals sign.</p>

<pre>
  # kagemai : Status = Accepted
</pre>

<p>You can also specify the field by its ID.</p>

<pre>
  # kagemai : status = Accepted
</pre>

<p>Lines that are recognized as field changing commands will be deleted from the message when it is received.</p>

<p>Currently, anyone can change the values of fields via e-mail; Kagemai does not distinguish who the user is.  In addition, it is possible to end up setting a field to a value that is not a valid choice.  (For example, even if "New", "Fixed", and "Resolved" are the only selections for "Status", it is possible to set "Status" to "Accepted" via e-mail.)  If these limitations are a problem, set <var>allow_mail_body_command</var> to false.</p>

<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

<h2 id="mrtg">Graphing with MRTG</h2>

<p>Kagemai has an action that will return the number of unresolved and unresolved bugs in plain-text format so that you can graph trends using MRTG.</p>

<p>If you have a project with an id of "test" and access guest.cgi with "mrtg" specified as the action (example: 
<em>http://www.example.net/kagemai/guest.cgi?project=test&action=mrtg&t=2</em>
), it will return a plain-text document with the number of unresolved bugs on the first line and the number of resolved bugs on the second line.</p>

<p>Refer to the mrtg_en/mrtg.cfg file in this distribution for
information on MRTG configuration.   (You will have to move the mrtg_en
folder to mrtg to display graphs in English; the default mrtg directory
is for Japanese users.)
Using these numbers, you can create <a href="http://www.daifukuya.com/kagemai/mrtg/kagemai-t2.html">graphs like this</a> (Japanese).</p>

<h2 id="multi">Using Kagemai for multiple bug tracking systems</h2>

<p>
You can use a single installation of Kagemai for multiple bug tracking systems.
</p>

<p>First, create a Web-accessible directory, and copy guest.cgi, user.cgi, and admin.cgi to it.  Copy kagemai.css and wallpaper.gif as well, if needed.</p>

<pre>
  $ mkdir public_html/my_bts
  $ cp /var/www/html/kagemai/*.cgi public_html/my_bts
  $ cp /var/www/html/kagemai/kagemai.css public_html/my_bts
  $ cp /var/www/html/kagemai/wallpaper.gif public_html/my_bts
</pre>

<p>Next, edit the <var>config_file</var> setting in guest.cgi.</p>

<pre>
  $ vi guest.cgi
  $ grep 'config_file' guest.cgi
  config_file  = '/home/fukuoka/public_html/my_bts/kagemai.conf'
</pre>

<p>Access admin.cgi and change the global setting <var>project_dir</var>.  Then, it will be possible to use Kagemai for a separate bug tracking system.</p>
